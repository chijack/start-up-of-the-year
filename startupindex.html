<!-- to make the h1,hr and button be in a row so that it can toggether be centered, he wrapped it in a div with class "row" -->

<!-- he wrapped h1 in a tag called header (and gave it a class of "text-center" so he can center the h1...cos that is the header info of the page. Next, he wrapped the hr and button in a <section> tag so that he can control(move aroound) that part together(ie. hr and button) and gave it a class of "text-center" so he can center it
 --><!-- In the header and section, he added col-12 so that these elements can occupy the full length(or width?) of the page, and bootstrap uses a 12 grid system. so to fully occupy will be col-12, less will be col-6, etc. If you go and inspect the page, you'll see the blue highlights show the fully occupying nature of the elements on the page. -->
<!-- to create space between the header and the section below, we create another div called buffer that envelops the hr and button so we can control it. It was given a col-12 so it can cover the entire area its in -->
